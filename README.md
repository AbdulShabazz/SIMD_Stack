# SIMD_Stack (High Priority Queue)
A high-performance priority queue and stack manager. 

The High Priority Queue supports O(1) sort-, push-, pop-, top- and bottom- runtime performance.

That being said, hardware accelerations to these operations, other technologies like ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits) or FPGAs (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays) might be appropriate: These technologies are designed to implement specific, well-defined operations very quickly, and are often used in hardware implementations of data structures or other algorithmic operations.
